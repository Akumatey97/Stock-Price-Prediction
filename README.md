# Stock-Price-Prediction
My project focuses on predicting the stock prices of Amazon, IBM, and Lucid using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is particularly effective in capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for stock price forecasting. This project involves data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation phases. By leveraging historical stock price data and applying the LSTM model, I aim to generate accurate future price predictions, offering valuable insights for investors and financial analysts. The project showcases my proficiency in Python, data analysis, and machine learning, highlighting a practical application of advanced predictive modeling techniques in finance.
